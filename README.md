# 207-Fraud-Detection-ML-Project

Authors: Coleman Davis, Amiya Prasad, Naeemah Robert, and Ramana Venkatesh

In our project, we aim to address several key questions:
How does the type of model affect the accuracy and precision of fraud detection models?

To what extent does age and class imbalance affect false positive and false negative rates in model predictions? 

What is the relationship between the number of features and the overall performance metrics of these models?
